# remote-resilience-list

A list of resources for ensuring cyber resilience during remote work boom. 

## Who is this for?

This list of security resources is built with the lone IT / Sysadmin / Security Manager in mind, who now has to adapt to a large amount of workforce accessing company infrastructure remotely. Surprisingly many large companies run with a very lean IT/Security team. 

Focus here is on free or freemium resources, products and services.
